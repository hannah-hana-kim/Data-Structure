I also **moved the `mypy` installation command** out of the first block and into the code block directly before **Question 2.1**. This should now mean that the top-of-file code block, which fetches these corrections, runs much faster!\n\n(Issues auto-fixed in Colab versions:)\n\n* *(2024-01-30, 7:00pm EST)* *In the second public test for **Question 5.2**, extraneous parentheses after `FancyLinkedList` removed; now updated to be `len(signature(FancyLinkedList.append).parameters) == 2`*\n* *(2024-01-28, 8:44pm EST)* *In **Question 4.1**, the description of the `Swimmer` class is from an older version of the homework, which had `favorite_event` instead of `favorite_swim_style`. So, please replace \"`compute_favorite_event()`\" with \"`compute_favorite_swim_style()`\" and replace \"`favorite_event` instance variable\" with \"`favorite_swim_style` instance variable\". Thank you to Yanfeng for discovering this issue!*\n* *(2024-01-28, 8:46pm EST)* *At the **end of the starter code** and in the **public tests** for **Question 4.2**, please replace the dictionary key `'average'` with the dictionary key `'favorites'` (matching the Q4.2 instructions).

        "Here, as one final step, we're going to apply a transformation which is extremely common (and extremely important!) for analyzing/comparing the runtimes of different algorithms. Notice how the values in `input_sizes` got **exponentially** larger each time: from `10` to `100` to `1000`. The default settings in Seaborn, however, produce **linear** plots of the data. While this is a reasonable default, it can be difficult to see the pattern of exactly when (at what value of $n$) the overhead required for merge sort becomes \"worth it\".\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to see this more clearly: take the plot you produced above and pass an additional argument to the Seaborn function telling it to plot **both** the $x$-axis **and** $y$-axis on a **logarithmic** rather than **linear** scale!\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note how, in the starter code for the previous question, we didn't import matplotlib.pyplot at the top of the cell (only near the end, for the autograder code). In the starter code for this question, however, we've imported both Seaborn **and** `matplotlib.pyplot` (using the alias `plt`) right at the top.  This is a big big hint for how you might transform the axes to use a log scale, using only ‼️two additional lines of code‼️)*"

The gist is: to take a system we have \"in our head\" and implement it in code, we break the system down into **pieces**, such that we can think about (a) what **properties** each piece would have, and then (b) how the pieces would **fit together**.\n",
        "\n",

The book has 14 chapters, each of which \"build up\" a system for digitizing and visualizing a swim coach's on-paper spreadsheets; it doesn't cover OOP, however, so you can think of this part of the assignment as you writing the 15th chapter to Barry's book 😎)*"

        "### Question 4.1\n",
        "\n",
        "So, to do this you'll need to create the following classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **`Team`**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the \"overarching\" class which will keep track of your entire team.\n",
        "\n",
        "It should have a **constructor** function which takes only the single argument (required for all contructor functions in Python) `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor should initialize the following **instance variables**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `swimmers`: An object which should start out as an empty Python `list` object (`[]`), but should be updated with each call to the `add_swimmer()` function, so that it will become a list of `Swimmer` objects specifically.\n",
        "\n",
        "And the class should have the following **instance methods**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `add_swimmer(self: Team, swimmer_obj: Swimmer) -> bool`: A Python **function** which takes the `Swimmer` object named `swimmer_obj` as its only argument (besides the required `self` object) and attempts to add this object to the `swimmers` instance variable (using the built-in `append()` function that all `list` objects in Python have). If it succeeds in adding the object to `swimmers`, the function should return the `bool` value `True`, otherwise it should return the `bool` value `False`.\n",
        "* `get_swimmer(self: Team, name: str) -> Swimmer | None`: A Python function which takes in a `str` value called `name` and returns one of two possible things: either (a) the first `Swimmer` object found within the `swimmers` instance variable whose name is `name`, or (b) the value `None` if no swimmer is found within the `swimmers` instance variable with this name. Your code for this function should utilize the `has_swimmer()` function described below, so don't start until you've also read the description for that function!\n",
        "* `get_swimmers(self: Team) -> list[Swimmer]`: Notice the pluralized **swimmers** rather than **swimmer** here! This function does not take in any arguments (besides the required `self` argument), and simply returns whatever value is stored in the `swimmers` instance variable for the object.\n",
        "* `has_swimmer(self: Team, name: str) -> bool`: A Python function which takes in a `str` value called `name` and returns the `bool` value `True` if a swimmer with that name exists on the team, and the `bool` value `False` otherwise. (You can assume that no two swimmers stored using your system will ever have the same name). (As mentioned above, this function should be called directly from within the `get_swimmer()` function)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **`Swimmer`**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Swimmer` class will keep track of all the information you have for a **single swimmer**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class should have a **constructor** function which takes arguments with the following names:\n",
        "  * `self: Swimmer` (required for all constructor and instance functions in Python)\n",
        "  * `name_arg: str`\n",
        "  * `age_arg: int`\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, within the constructor function, your code should create **instance variables** as follows:\n",
        "  * `name`: A `str` representing the swimmer's full name, which should be set to have the value of the argument `name_arg` that was passed to the constructor (see above)\n",
        "  * `age`: An `int` representing the swimmer's age, in years, which should be set to have the value of the argument `age_arg` that was passed to the constructor (see above)\n",
        "  * `results`: A `list` object which should start out without any elements (`[]`) when the `Swimmer` object is created (in other words, it should be assigned the value `[]` within the constructor function for `Swimmer`), but should be **updated** to contain `EventResult` objects whenever the `add_result()` instance method is called (see below).\n",
        "  * `favorite_swim_style`: An object which should start out with the value `None` when the `Swimmer` object is first created (so, in the constructor function for the `Swimmer` class), but should be set to a value of type `SwimStyle` by a **function** within the `Swimmer` class called `compute_favorite_swim_style()`, which is described below.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class should have the following **instance methods**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `get_name(self) -> str`: Returns the current value contained in the `name` instance variable\n",
        "* `get_age(self) -> int`: Returns the current value contained in the `age` instance variable\n",
        "* `add_result(self, result_obj) -> bool`: Similar to the `add_swimmer()` function described above for the `Team` class, this function should take in an argument called `result_obj`, but should return the `bool` value `False` if `result_obj` is not an object of type `EventResult`. If `result_obj` *is* an object of type `EventResult`, then this function should add it to the end of the `results` instance variable. Finally (before the end of the function), it should call the `compute_favorite_swim_style()` function (which will ensure that the `favorite_swim_style` instance variable is kept up-to-date as events are added). If the adding was successful, and the call to `compute_favorite_swim_style()` also completed successfully (returned the boolean value `True`), then this function (`add_result()`) should return the `bool` value `True`.\n",
        "* `compute_favorite_swim_style(self) -> None`: This function should iterate through the instance variable called `results` and determine the most common value of `swim_style` across all of these results (so, in particular, you don't need to pay attention to the **distance** that was swum for any of the results). For example, if the swimmer has 8 recorded times for Freestyle events, but only 6 recorded times for Backstroke event type (and no recorded times for the other two possible styles), this function should identify `SwimStyle.FREESTYLE` as that swimmer's favorite swim style. If two or more possible swim styles are **tied**, you should return the one that comes **first in the alphabet**: if `SwimStyle.BACKSTROKE` and `SwimStyle.BUTTERFLY` are tied for a given swimmer, for example, your function should identify `SwimStyle.BACKSTROKE` as that swimmer's favorite style.\n",

Rather than frantically trying to look for the lines of code in some for loop somewhere, now you know exactly what to do: you can just update the **internal** code within that function, and all of the other \"pieces\" in your system don't have to work any differently. They call the \"black box\" of the `compute_favorite_swim_style()` function just as before, and receive a `SwimStyle` object just as before, without ever needing to \"know\" that anything has changed **inside of** the function!"

        "This is because, as surprising as it may sound, a **huge** portion of the data structures which may seem fancier than Linked Lists are in fact just created by making **slight modifications** to the basic structure described in the above bullet points.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you've heard of a data structure called a **Binary Search Tree**, this fancier data structure is almost identical to the Linked List structure, except that wherever a Linked List has a **single** pointer to the next element (which we called `next` above), a Binary Search Tree has **two** pointers, one named `left` and another named `right`. This means that, quite literally, you could add one additional line to the code you'll write in this part to change it from implementing a Linked List to implementing a Binary Search Tree.\n",

        "Building on this, even some of the fanciest algorithms in common usage, like the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree' target='_blank'>Quadtree</a> structure that we saw in Week 2 when we discussed how Google Maps works, can once again be constructed via a tiny modification to a Binary Search Tree: each `Node` object now has **four pointers**, `ne`, `se`, `nw`, and `sw`. I promise, I'm not oversimplifying here; understanding how Linked Lists works is genuinely the key which unlocks a \"language\" for you to understand how fancier algorithms like the Quadtree are structured!"
